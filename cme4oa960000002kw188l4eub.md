I've used **Traktor Pro** with a **Novation Launchpad MK2** and **Launch Control XL MK2** for years because that pairing fits my hands and workflow perfectly.

But I was haunted by an intermittent nightmare: sometimes Traktor ignored my mappings, sometimes pads pressed did nothing, and I'd end up unplugging/replugging USB cables over and over until things "magically" worked.

This post documents the exact fix that solved it for me on macOS (After Years of Random Failures), plus a short checklist to keep your setup stable.

## TL;DR

If your Launchpad MK2 (or other MIDI gear) feels invisible to Traktor—mappings don't trigger, LEDs don't update—repair your macOS MIDI configuration in Audio MIDI Setup.

In my case, simply **rescanning/rebuilding the MIDI Studio configuration** cleared "ghost" devices and restored reliable communication.

## The Symptoms

* Traktor opens, my custom mappings are loaded, but pads trigger nothing.
    
* Sometimes the mapping responds... until the next reboot or USB shuffle.
    
* Replugging USB "fixes" it—temporarily.
    

I chased cables, hubs, and app order. None of that lasted.

## The Fix (macOS): Rescan / Rebuild MIDI Studio

1. **Open Audio MIDI Setup** (Applications → Utilities).
    
2. **Choose Window → Show MIDI Studio**.
    
3. **Click Rescan MIDI**. If things still look odd (devices greyed out or duplicated), create a **new MIDI configuration** (MIDI Studio → pop-up at the top → **New Configuration**), then select it. You can also **Edit Configurations** to duplicate/rename/delete a broken default config.

**Why this works:** macOS keeps a MIDI device database that can get messy over time. Rescanning or starting from a clean configuration clears stale/ghost entries so apps see the real devices again. If you're still stuck, some advanced users even rebuild the "Default.mcfg" file (back up first).

After doing this, my Launchpad MK2 + Launch Control XL MK2 combo became **rock-solid** in Traktor.

## Make It Stick: 5-Minute Stability Checklist

### 1) Pin Your MIDI Ports in Traktor

In **Preferences → Controller Manager**, set **In-Port** and **Out-Port** to the **exact device** (don't leave them on **All Ports**). NI's own docs recommend this to avoid conflicts—multiple active mappings can "listen" at once if you leave All Ports enabled.

There's also a long-running report that **All Ports** can fail to receive commands after startup until you toggle the port—another reason to be explicit.

### 2) Verify the Launchpad MK2's MIDI Channel Mode

The MK2 uses **User 1** and **User 2** modes on specific channels (**User 1** = **Ch. 6-8**, **User 2** = **Ch. 14-16**). If your mapping expects Ch. 6 and your device is on 7 or 14, nothing will fire. You can change these channels via the device's bootloader setup.

### 3) Keep Firmware / Drivers Current

Novation provides firmware updates (**MK2 firmware v171**) and the latest USB drivers (Windows). Staying current eliminates edge-case USB/MIDI quirks.

### 4) Confirm MIDI Is Actually Arriving

When in doubt, use **SnoizeMIDI Monitor** on macOS to watch note/CC data in real time. It's perfect for proving the hardware is talking even before you open Traktor. (Many vendors recommend it in their troubleshooting guides.)

### 5) Avoid Mapping Collisions

If you juggle multiple TSI files, disable what you're not using (or set **In/Out to None**) and only leave the active mapping bound to your Launchpad/Launch Control. This prevents unintentional "double-listening."

## Bonus: LED Feedback Basics (if your pads don't light)

If pads trigger functions but LEDs don't reflect states, double-check you've set the **Out-Port** correctly and that your mapping sends the expected LED command values to the Launchpad. (Many Traktor mappers send status back to the same channel the pad listens on.) Community resources and tools cover how to structure LED feedback if you're rolling your own map.

## Final Thoughts

I was close to abandoning this setup, but **repairing the macOS MIDI Studio configuration** plus pinning explicit MIDI ports in Traktor turned everything around. If you love the Launch Control XL MK2 + Launchpad MK2 workflow as much as I do, try the rescan/rebuild first—it might be your one-and-done solution.

If you need to debug further, confirm raw MIDI with **MIDI Monitor** and revisit channel modes/firmware. Once the foundations are clean, Traktor tends to behave beautifully.
