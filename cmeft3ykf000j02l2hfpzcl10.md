Keep Your Mac Clean and Fast with CleanMyMac — 2025 Review

Hello, this is Daisuke. Today, I’d like to introduce CleanMyMac, a powerful maintenance app for macOS. If you want to keep your Mac running smoothly, free up storage, or get lightweight malware protection, this app is worth checking out.

In this article, I’ll cover: • What is CleanMyMac? • Latest version and updates • Key features (by module) • Real-world reviews and impressions • Pros, cons, and final thoughts

1. What is CleanMyMac?
    

CleanMyMac is a maintenance and optimization utility for macOS, first released in 2008 by MacPaw, a Ukrainian software company. It removes unnecessary files, boosts system performance, and provides malware protection — all in one package ([en.wikipedia.org](http://en.wikipedia.org)).

It has also won several international design awards, such as the Red Dot Award and iF Design Award, thanks to its clean and intuitive user interface ([en.wikipedia.org](http://en.wikipedia.org)).

2. Latest Version and Updates (as of August 2025) • The latest version is 5.2.3, released on August 13, 2025, with minor bug fixes ([apps.apple.com](http://apps.apple.com)). • The earlier 5.2.1 update (July 29, 2025) introduced Cloud Cleanup, allowing you to organize files in iCloud Drive, Google Drive, and OneDrive directly from CleanMyMac ([macpaw.com](http://macpaw.com)). • Space Lens, the storage visualization tool, made a comeback in June 2025. It displays folder sizes in bubbles, making it easy to spot what’s taking up space ([macpaw.com](http://macpaw.com)).
